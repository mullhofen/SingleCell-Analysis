# SingleCell-Analysis
2nd semester MSc Biotechnology course projects

## DryLab 1
Analysis of brain-organoid scRNA-seq. data from Kanton et. al., Nature Journal 2019
Complete workflow from raw scRNA-seq. data through data integration and cell annotation

## DryLab 2
Analysis of single-cell multiome data (RNA & ATAC)
Data set: from Wahle et al., BioRxiv 2022 (soon out in Nat Biotech!) 
Single-cell multimome data from one 35 week old Retina organoid
• Individual analysis of scRNA-seq portion of the data including feature selection, 2D embedding, annotation
• Individual 2D embedding analysis of scATAC-seq portion
• Bi-modal integrative analysis of both modalities including peak-gene linkage and TF binding motif enrichment
• Analysis of TF regulomes using PANDO
